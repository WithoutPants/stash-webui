### **Warning:** this is an experimental release. Use at your own risk!

Please ensure you back up your **entire** stash system before using this build. This build should be considered experimental.

After migrating, please run a scan on your entire library to populate missing data, and to ingest identical files which were previously ignored.

Please report all issues to the following Github issue: https://github.com/stashapp/stash/issues/2737

### **Warning:** if you are upgrading from an older `files-refactor` build, you will need to re-migrate your system from a schema version 31 database.

### ðŸ’¥ Known issues
* Import/export functionality is currently disabled. Needs further design.
* Missing covers are not currently regenerated. Need to consider further, especially around scene cover redesign.

### Other changes:
* Added support for filtering and sorting by file count. ([#2744](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2744))
* Changelog has been moved from the stats page to a section in the Settings page.
* Object titles are now displayed as the file basename if the title is not explicitly set. The `Don't include file extension as part of the title` scan flag is no longer supported.
* `Set name, date, details from embedded file metadata` scan flag is no longer supported. This functionality may be implemented as a built-in scraper in the future.
