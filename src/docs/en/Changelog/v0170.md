After migrating, please run a scan on your entire library to populate missing data, and to ingest identical files which were previously ignored.

### ðŸ’¥ Known issues and other changes
* Missing covers are not currently regenerated.
* Import/export schema has changed and is incompatible with the previous version.

### âœ¨ New Features
* Added support for identical files. Identical files are assigned to the same scene/gallery/image and can be viewed in File Info. ([#2676](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2676))
* Added support for filtering and sorting by file count. ([#2744](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2744))
* Added release notes dialog. ([#2726](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2726))

### ðŸŽ¨ Improvements
* Object titles are now displayed as the file basename if the title is not explicitly set. The `Don't include file extension as part of the title` scan flag is no longer supported.
* `Set name, date, details from embedded file metadata` scan flag is no longer supported. This functionality may be implemented as a built-in scraper in the future.
* Moved Changelogs to Settings page. ([#2726](https://github.com/stashapp/stash/pull/2726))
