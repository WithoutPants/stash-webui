### **Warning:** this is an experimental release. Use at your own risk!

Please ensure you back up your **entire** stash system before using this build. This build should be considered experimental.

This migration significantly changes the way that stash stores information about your files. This migration is not reversible.

After migrating, please run a scan on your entire library to populate missing data, and to ingest identical files which were previously ignored.
